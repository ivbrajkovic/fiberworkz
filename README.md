## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1. System Architecture

- **Component-Level Architecture:**  
  The application is built using Angular’s component-based methodology. Each UI element is encapsulated within its own component which promotes reusability and maintainability.
- **Services & Dependency Injection:**  
  Business logic and data operations are encapsulated within Angular services, injected where needed. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and easier unit testing.
- **Routing and Navigation:**  
  Angular Router is employed to handle in-app navigation and lazy loading, optimizing performance by loading modules on demand.
- **Reactive Data Handling:**  
  Using RxJS observables, the application responds dynamically to data changes, providing real-time feedback to users.
- **Integration with Backend:**  
  All API communications are handled through HTTP interceptors and services, ensuring secure and consistent interaction with backend endpoints.

### 2.2. Tech Stack & Dependencies

- **Framework:** Angular
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** SCSS with a responsive design framework
- **UI Library:** @recognizebv/vwui-angular – provides a rich set of Angular components
- **Data Handling:** RxJS for reactive programming
- **Internationalization:** ngx-translate for multi-language support
- **Testing:** Jasmine & Karma for unit testing and Protractor for end-to-end testing
- **Important:** All dependencies are kept up-to-date to leverage the latest features and security updates.

## 3. Application Structure

### 3.1. Directory Structure

```
c:\Users\ivanb\Desktop\Valcon\fiberworkz\Fiberworkz.Frontend\ClientApp
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── components/      // Standalone Angular components (e.g., survey, project dashboard)
│   │   ├── services/        // Business logic, API calls, and state management services
│   │   ├── models/          // TypeScript interfaces and models
│   │   ├── shared/          // Reusable modules, directives, pipes & custom components
│   │   └── assets/          // Images, styles, locales, etc.
├── src/environments/         // Environment configurations for development, staging, and production
└── e2e/                     // End-to-end test cases
```

### 3.2. Key Packages & Responsibilities

- **components/** – Contains all the Angular components that drive the UI.
- **services/** – Handles all data operations, business logic, and API interactions.
- **models/** – Defines the data structure and interfaces used across the application.
- **shared/** – Houses shared functionality like custom directives, pipes, and re-usable UI elements.
- **Important:** Clear module boundaries are critical to maintain code quality and scalability.

## 4. Domain Model & API Integration

While the frontend does not manage a local database, it integrates closely with backend services:

### 4.1. API Documentation

- **REST Endpoints Consumption:**  
  The application consumes secured REST endpoints to fetch and update user data, survey details, project statuses, etc.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  JWT-based authentication is implemented; HTTP interceptors manage token injection and error handling.
- **Important:** A strong emphasis is placed on secure and efficient API integrations to ensure data integrity and performance.

---

## 5. Business Logic & Workflows

- **Core Processes:**  
  Critical user workflows, such as survey initiation, project management, and notification handling, are orchestrated via Angular services.
- **Exception Handling:**  
  Global error interceptors capture runtime errors and propagate user-friendly messages. Custom error components ensure users are informed of any issues.
- **Workflow Management:**  
  Reactive forms and RxJS streams manage dynamic form inputs and state changes, ensuring a responsive user experience.

---

## 6. Deployment & Environment Setup

### 6.1. Local Development Setup

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Node.js (version 16 or later)
  - Angular CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- **Running the App:**  
  Execute `ng serve` to start the development server at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

### 6.2. Production Deployment

- **Build Command:**  
  Use `ng build --prod` to generate an optimized production build.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  The project integrates with a CI/CD pipeline that automates testing, building, and deployment using tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
- **Important:** Proper environment configuration (via `src/environments/`) ensures a smooth transition between development, staging, and production.

## 7. Logging, Monitoring & Debugging

### 7.1. Logging

- **Client-Side Logging:**  
  Logs are generated for critical actions and errors. Integration with third-party services like Sentry provides real-time error tracking.
- **Important:** Establishing a consistent logging strategy aids in quick troubleshooting and ensuring application reliability.

### 7.2. Monitoring & Debugging

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Tools such as Google Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools are used to monitor performance metrics.
- **Debugging Tips:**  
  Angular DevTools and console logging facilitate debugging and performance tuning.
- **Important:** Monitoring is key for proactive detection of issues before they impact users.
